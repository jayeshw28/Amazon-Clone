      <h1>Returns & Orders Policy</h1>

      <div className="policy-body">
        At our Amazon store, we strive to ensure customer satisfaction with
        every purchase. As part of this commitment, we have a clear and
        transparent return and exchange policy in place to make your shopping
        experience with us hassle-free.
        <h4>Return Policy</h4> If for any reason, you are not satisfied with
        your purchase, you can return it to us within 30 days of receiving the
        product. However, some products may have a shorter return window, so
        please check the product description carefully. To initiate a return,
        simply go to your order history and select the item(s) you want to
        return. Once you have initiated a return, we will provide you with a
        return label that you can print and attach to the package. Please ensure
        that the product is in its original condition and packaging, and all
        accessories, manuals, and warranties are included. Once we receive the
        product, we will inspect it to ensure that it meets our return criteria.
        If everything is in order, we will initiate a refund to your original
        payment method. Please note that some products may not be eligible for
        return, such as perishable items, personalized products, and digital
        content.
        <h4>Exchange Policy</h4>If you received a defective or damaged product,
        or if you received the wrong item, you can exchange it for a new one
        within 30 days of receiving the product. To initiate an exchange, go to
        your order history and select the item(s) you want to exchange. Once you
        have initiated an exchange, we will provide you with a return label that
        you can print and attach to the package. Please ensure that the product
        is in its original condition and packaging, and all accessories,
        manuals, and warranties are included. Once we receive the product, we
        will inspect it to ensure that it meets our exchange criteria. If
        everything is in order, we will ship a new product to you as soon as
        possible. Please note that some products may not be eligible for
        exchange, such as perishable items, personalized products, and digital
        content.
        <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>You can cancel your order at any time before
        it is shipped. If you want to cancel your order, please go to your order
        history and select the item(s) you want to cancel. Once you have
        initiated a cancellation, we will refund your payment to your original
        payment method within 5-7 business days. Please note that our return,
        exchange, and cancellation policies may vary depending on the product
        and the seller. We encourage you to carefully read the product
        description and seller information before making a purchase. If you have
        any questions or concerns about our policies, please feel free to
        contact our customer service team, who will be happy to assist you.
